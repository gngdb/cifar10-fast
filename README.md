This fork was used to run experiments adjacent to another piece of work
focusing on simplified linear transforms. Rough notes on this can be found
in the [research log](research_log.md).

Although, those notes and results are spread over two branches. One was
dedicated to investigating whether weight decay scaling was a good idea,
and the other to what settings to use with Tensor-Train decompositions.
